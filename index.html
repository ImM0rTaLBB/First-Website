    <p>The world as we know it is gone. At the center of the destruction lies a hidden society of Revenants called Vein. <br>
        Those who remain fight for survival by acquiring Gifts of power in exchange for their memories, and an ever-increasing thirst for blood. <br>
        Give into the bloodlust fully and risk becoming one of the Lost; fiendish ghouls devoid of any remaining humanity who wander aimlessly in search of blood. <br>
        Team up and embark on a journey to the ends of hell to unlock your past and escape your living nightmare in CODE VEIN.</p>
